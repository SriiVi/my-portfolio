Above all are the tags taught in the class. Depending on the theme and all, use as much as possible accordingly and responsibly. Keep all these things before you give me the code finally.

Now all I have to choose is the theme and problem statement for this. Make sure that when you suggest I need to make at least 5 webpages. 
Also I have to pay attention to the design and layout of the website, the colours and typography as well. Make sure that I am exploring visually as much as possible and it should look visually aesthetic. 

Childhood Curiosity Hub is okay. Mini Mindfulness Breaks and The burnout cycle sounds new and the design archive idea is also nice. Make sure whatever you suggest is jury worthy and it should have proper validation and reason for everything. 
Suggest me the one which has maximum potential as per all above criteria. If any new ideas are there, suggest that also
